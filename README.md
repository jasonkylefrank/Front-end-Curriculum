React Curriculum
=======

This "curriculum" is a curated list of information and resources to help my team learn the React.js ecosystem.  This includes Redux and possibly other things like the React router and build tool information.

Most of this curriculum is about learning concepts. Along the way, I point out some things that tripped me up initially.  I also add some clarifying commentary that I felt was missing from most of the resources that I found.
