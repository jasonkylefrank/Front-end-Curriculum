Front-end Curriculum
=======

This "curriculum" is a curated list of information and resources to help my team learn our new front-end technology stack and architecture.

Major topics include:
* The React.js ecosystem
* Styling technologies
* Naming methodologies
* Build systems
* JavaScript techniques


Most of this curriculum is about learning concepts. Along the way, I point out some things that tripped me up initially.  I also add some clarifying commentary that I felt was missing from most of the resources that I found.
