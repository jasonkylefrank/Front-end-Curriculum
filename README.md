React Curriculum
=======

This "curriculum" is a curated list of information and resources to help my team learn React.js and Redux.  



# Redux
Redux is the Flux implementation that we are using to tie our components together.


## Actions


### Asynchronous actions (e.g., web requests)
Actions which should not execute synchronously require a different approach.  This YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/764wvf8KuTw?t=1121) explains the concept.
