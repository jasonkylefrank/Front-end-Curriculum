#ES6 JavaScript

ES6 (or ES2015) is the latest standard version of JavaScript.  More specifically, ECMAScript (ES) is the language *specification* for JavaScript implementations.

We are seeing the JavaScript community using ES6, and much of the *React* community in particular seems to favor using it over the older ES5.  And from my experience using ES6 and reading other people's ES6 code, it is a welcome update.

Overall I think ES6 makes JavaScript coding *easier* and *safer* to write and understand.  And I think the learning curve is fairly low. 

Perhaps I will eventually break down this chapter into more detailed subsections.  But for now I just list some learning resources and brief commentary about them.  

##Learning Resources

Based on my experience reading other people's ES6 code, my recommendation for learning ES6 is to focus on the new syntax additions - instead of new *methods* on native objects (like Array, String, and Math).

5. [**Exploring ES6**](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html) by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer:  This is a full ebook.  Its probably not the best place to start your learning. But if you want a larger reference or more-detailed explanations, this looks like a good source.  The author seems to be well-respected in the industry.
