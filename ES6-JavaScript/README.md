#ES6 JavaScript

ES6 (or ES2015) is the latest standard version of JavaScript.  More specifically, ECMAScript (ES) is the language *specification* for JavaScript implementations.

We are seeing the JavaScript community using ES6, and much of the *React* community in particular seems to favor using it over the older ES5.  And from my experience using ES6 and reading other people's ES6 code, it is a welcome update.

Overall I think ES6 makes JavaScript coding *easier* and *safer* to write and understand.  And I think the learning curve is fairly low. 

Perhaps I will eventually break down this chapter into more detailed subsections.  But for now I just list some learning resources and brief commentary about them.
