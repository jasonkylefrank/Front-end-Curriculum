#ES6 JavaScript

ES6 (or ES2015) is the latest standard version of JavaScript.  More specifically, ECMAScript (ES) is the language *specification* for JavaScript implementations.

We are seeing the JavaScript community using ES6, and much of the *React* community in particular seems to favor using it over the older ES5.  And from my experience using ES6 and reading other people's ES6 code, it is a welcome update.

Overall I think ES6 makes JavaScript coding *easier* and *safer* to write and understand.  And I think the learning curve is fairly low. 

Perhaps I will eventually break down this chapter into more detailed subsections.  But for now I just list some learning resources and brief commentary about them.  

## Learning Resources

### Preface

#### What to learn first
I would categorize ES6's main additions as: 
1. Syntax additions
2. New methods on native objects (like Array, String, and Math).

When you're first learning ES6, I think a good first goal is to be able to understand other people's ES6 code.  With that goal in mind, I recommend starting with the new *syntax* additions.  In contrast, the new *methods* will syntactically look the same, and will thus not trip you up - you can just look up what they do when you get to them.

#### Tips that I've not seen well-explained

### Resources List

1. **[ECMAScript 6 (ES6): Whatâ€™s New In The Next Version Of JavaScript](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/es6-whats-new-next-version-javascript/)** by Lars Kappert (Smashing Magazine): This article talks about features in a to-the-point manner - focusing mostly on examples.  As stated in the preface above, I would skip over the sections that talk about new methods on the String, Math, and Array objects for now.  
2. **[Top 10 ES6 Features Every Busy JavaScript Developer Must Know](http://webapplog.com/es6/)** by Webapplog: This one complements the Smashing Magazine article above because it talks about a few different features than what that one does.

5. [**Exploring ES6**](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html) by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer:  This is a full ebook.  Its probably not the best place to start your learning. But if you want a larger reference or more-detailed explanations, this looks like a good source.  The author seems to be well-respected in the industry.
