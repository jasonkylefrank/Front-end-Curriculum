# Learn Redux

In a previous section, I discussed [**why**](../Why-Redux/README.md) we are using Redux.  If you haven't yet read that section and watched the videos posted there, **I recommend that you start there**.  They will show some of the basics and illustrate why you'll want to do things a certain way.

After you've explored the "Why Redux" section, head over to the Redux [Getting Started](./Getting-Started/README.md) section if you're brand new.
