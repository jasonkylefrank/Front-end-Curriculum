# React

## What is React?
React is a library for building UIs with ***components***.  The idea with components is that implementation details can be abstracted away into manageable chunks that can be more-easily reasoned about. 

Quick aside: you'll soon learn that in the React community the term "reason about" must be used at least 12 times in any documentation in order for it to gain acceptance.  

Additionally *composing* these abstractions becomes a powerful programming tool.
