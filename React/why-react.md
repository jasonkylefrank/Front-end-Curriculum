#Why use React.js?

<p class="todo-note">
<strong>Todo</strong>: Create <em>sections</em> that discuss each reason...

For now, I just have a list of resources and some commentary about them.
</p>

1. Video “[**Thinking in Components: Building Powerful UIs in React.js**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSGuffp0o6E&index=6&list=PLRHV6us9ju3R5eV7pVI8VOyWpfG2U3v1c)”.  This is a little old now (Nov 2014), but it shows some things pretty decent.  Things like:
 
   1. Problems with MVC frameworks
   2. The one-way data flow concept
   3. The power of using JavaScript instead of “Domain Specific Language” constructs (DSL) (like Knockout’s “foreach”, “if” and such that we have to put in our *markup*).  **Note that since React does not use DSL constructs, this is a large differentiating factor**.
 <br />
 <br />
This one is **not a tutorial**, but is a decent one to watch to start to understand concepts and general code issues.  Again, note that it is a tad dated now, and some of the code things he does are not necessarily the current “best practices” or the way that we will do them.  But that’s not his point.
 <br /><br />

2.  Video: “[**Getting Started with React.js: React is Different**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68NzBI6RRKE)”.  This one is also a year old, and only deals with concepts.  Like the previous video, it talks about DSL issues, etc.  Note that it appears to be a part of a video series, which may get into more of a tutorial – but I’ve not watched the other ones, so I’m not sure if they are good ones to follow.  And since its a little old, it may not be the best one to follow for a tutorial.
