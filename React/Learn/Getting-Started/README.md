# Getting stared learning React

## Some concepts
To begin, it may be helpful to read or watch some resources which focus on concepts.  One such concept is React's **unidirectional data flow**.  Another is its **Virtual DOM**. You will see and hear about these quite a bit. The following diagram can serve as a reference for these two concepts:

At that point he's using the React Router and passing data between components in a non-contrived way.
