#Who's using React?
In this chapter, you'll learn about other companies that are using React, as well as why they decided to use it.

**Facebook**, the creator of React, [eats their own dog food](http://www.reactnative.com/a-closer-look-of-how-react-native-is-used-at-facebook/).  **Instagram** (owned by Facebook), not surpisingly also uses React.  React is used in production by many other companies you know.  

According to [this video](https://youtu.be/Q6Kczrgw6ic?t=504), its used by **Netflix**, **Twitter**, **Apple**, and **AirBnB**:

The list does not end there. Others [include](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Sites-Using-React):
* Atlassian (makers of HipChat)
* BBC
* Dailymotion
* Dropbox
* Imgur
* Intuit
* Khan Academy
* Mapbox
* Paypal
* Rally (CA Technologies)
* Reddit
* Salesforce
* The New York Times
* Uber
* WhatsApp
* Wired
* Wordpress.com
* Yahoo

Perhaps one of the most notable companies for the G2 team to note that is now using React and Redux is... **Rally** (or CA technologies as they are now known).  They are a good example of an enterprise application that is heavily focused on data using the React ecosystem at scale.

##Why do big-name companies use React?


### Why **Netflix** uses React

Netflix [likes React](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/01/netflix-likes-react.html) because of its performance, scalability, and compositional design patterns.

### Why **Yahoo mail** uses React

When Yahoo mail [revamped their front-end](http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/101682875656/evolving-yahoo-mail), they wanted:
* Predictable flow ~ Easy Debugging
* Independently deployable components
* Shorter learning curve 
* No dependency on large platform libraries

They evaluated Ember.js, Angular.js, Knockout.js, Durandal, Rivets, and React. They chose React. They said that it "felt like a good solution to make debugging and understand data flows much easier and predictable". 

### Why **Atlassian** uses React

Atlassian, makers of Jira, BitBucket, and HipChat, also considered Angular and Ember. They [chose React](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/02/rebuilding-hipchat-with-react/) because they believed it had several advantages.  A few they cited include:
* Its focus on **Components**: they cited being able to share code with native clients (desktop apps, mobile apps)
* React's **Virtual DOM** speed
* **Simplicity**: "The public API can be memorized in a day and once you've built your first component, it's easy to build the next one with confidence that it'll just work."
* **Unidirectional data flow**: "The benefit of this is that you know exactly where your data is mutating, making it easier to test and maintain your app."
* **Testability**: "React components simplify testing greatly. As a proof of it's simplicity, our new web client has more tests than any of our other clients."

Regarding sharing code with native clients, they are referring to one of React's unique advantages: [**React Native**](https://youtu.be/KVZ-P-ZI6W4?t=1035).  This allows them to create truly native apps using their React components.  They explain that, "This means all of the complex logic of managing message rendering, history fetching, user states, scrolling animations and state management will all be handled by React â€” **greatly simplifying our native client code**."  They go on to say that, "The **dev speed** we've gained with React+Flux (and its friends: gulp, webpack, lodash, karma) proves that we can release new client features faster and with more confidence on this platform than on any native client."

### Why **Rally** (CA Technologies) uses React

At the moment I did not find a great resource that focused on *why* CA Technologies chose to use React, but I can recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQo0EdHNjto) by one of their developers.  He talks about what they've learned from the trenches while creating a React UI component library for use in our products.  I hope to point to specific sections of this video in other parts of this book.
